# PD-L1-QSAR-ML

This project applies machine learning and QSAR modeling techniques to the field of drug discovery.

Drug discovery is a complex and time-consuming process. QSAR modeling and machine learning offer a powerful combination to streamline the process.

QSAR modeling establishes a mathematical relationship between a molecule's chemical structure and its biological activity. It allows researchers to predict the activity of new compounds based on their structure, without the need for extensive wet-lab experiments.

Here's how machine learning comes into play:
1. Feature Extraction
2. Model Building
3. Activity Prediction

Benefits of using QSAR modeling and machine learning in drug discovery:
1. Reduced reliance on expensive laboratory experiments
2. Faster identification of potential drug candidates
3. Prioritization of promising leads for further development
4. Exploration of a wider chemical space for drug discovery
